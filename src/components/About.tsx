        <p>This is a portfolio for showcasing my photography, one of my biggest hobbies once upon a time.</p>
        <p>All images were taken using a Sony DSC-RX100 II and V cameras.</p>
        <p>I shoot mostly in manual and record in raw format. I also use CaptureOne to edit my work.</p>
        <p>This website was written in React with Typescript. All photos are uploaded on AWS S3 and served by AWS CloudFront, the album info is stored on IBM Cloudant (CouchDB), and the site is hosted on IBM CloudFoundry.</p>
        <p>The source code can be found on <a href='https://www.github.com/r-c-s/rcsphoto' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Thanks for viewing!</p>
